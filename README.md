Part 1: Proposal

(More details on submission format, lengths, etc, will be provided soon, but this is enough to get started with)

A. Output
Provide a story board or description (sketch, whatever) of your concept for your output. What are you going to produce? What will it look/sound like?

B. Architecture
Provide an architectural diagram indicating the components you plan to take from elsewhere (with sources in footnotes), those you plan to make yourselves, how they fit together. (Use the informal architectural description style we will go over in class similar to the one used in the original Project description lecture slides, but with more details)

C. Fusion
Provide more details on how you're going to merge the different kinds of analyses to create the output you described in Part A. Algorithms and pseudocode are fine, as long as they're clear, and free from low-level implementation details.

D. Code bases
Provide more details on the code bases you've found to analyse. Tell us why they're right for the analysis tools you've picked, and for the representation you will produce. Also tell us if you have to do anything to the code to make it "consumable" by your analysis tools, or whether it can be straightforwardly fed to them.
Your proposal will be marked for clarity and communication. In class we are going to go over how to describe an architecture informally, and you should follow the communication guidelines there. You will receive feedback on your concept and its feasibility, but you will not be marked on that (at this point in the project).
